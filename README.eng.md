## üë∑ Context of the SA√â* (Learning and Evaluation Situation)

> *SA√â: Learning and Evaluation Situation _("Situation d'Apprentissage et d'√âvaluation" in French)_

During this SA√â, we had to create a website on a topic of our choice. The content of our site had to strictly comply with the specifications that had been provided to us at the beginning of the SA√â.
<hr>

## üéØ Objectives of this SA√â
- To confront us with a first ambitious development project, requiring us to organize ourselves to be effective and meet deadlines;
- To teach us how to combine resources related to development and integration and understand how they fit together to automate the production of websites;
- To sensitize us to the need to respect web integration standards and best practices;
- To enable us to become autonomous on our workstation by mastering a development environment (code editing, validation, inspection, and local hosting of websites).
